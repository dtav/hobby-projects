THAT'S SO BEAUTIFUL,
HONEY. OKAY, NEXT.

163
00:06:37,367 --> 00:06:40,267
AND THEN -- AND THEN --
THERE WAS THIS ONE TIME

164
00:06:40,334 --> 00:06:42,868
WHEN WE WENT
TO ST. LOUIS --

165
00:06:42,934 --> 00:06:43,868
UH-HUH.

00:06:46,434 --> 00:06:48,634
* WHO WAS BORN ONE DAY
IN A MUFFIN PAN *

Both: * HE RAN AWAY
FROM THE BAKER'S SHOP *

169
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:52,767
* AND THEN HE MARRIED
A LOLLIPOP *

00:06:52,834 --> 00:06:53,767
OKAY, OKAY, OKAY.

171
00:06:53,834 --> 00:06:55,767
OKAY,
THAT WAS BEAUTIFUL.

172
00:06:55,834 --> 00:06:57,767

WHY DON'T WE GO
TO THE PARK NOW?

180
00:07:18,801 --> 00:07:20,334
GO UP AND GRAB YOUR SWEATERS

AND WE'LL GET
YOUR LITTLE BROTHER.

183
00:07:23,667 --> 00:07:26,100
WOULD YOU PLEASE BURY
MR. FEENEY IN THE BACKYARD?

184
00:07:26,167 --> 00:07:27,501

00:07:35,467 --> 00:07:39,000
I DON'T WANT THE GIRLS
TO SEE. OKAY?

189

YEAH.

190
00:07:44,467 --> 00:07:46,634
WELL, WHY DON'T YOU GUYS
GO AHEAD TO THE GAME?

191
00:07:46,701 --> 00:07:48,801
AND I'LL JUST GET THERE
WHEN I CAN.

192
00:07:48,868 --> 00:07:50,234
YOU SURE THERE'S
NOTHING WE CAN DO?

193
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,300
WELL, YOU CAN HELP ME DIG.

194
00:07:52,367 --> 00:07:54,834
IT'S JUST
AN EXPRESSION.

195
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,334
Radio: THAT LAST PLAY,
GAINING ABOUT A YARD.

196
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,601
SO, BATCH AND THE LIONS

197
00:08:10,667 --> 00:08:12,167
FACED WITH A THIRD AND GOAL.

CALL AT
THE EIGHT-YARD LINE.

WE'RE TIED AT 17,
BUT DON'T GO ANYWHERE.

200
00:08:17,367 --> 00:08:18,801
HERE'S THE SNAP.

TO HIS RIGHT.

202
00:08:21,434 --> 00:08:24,133
LOOKING IN THE END ZONE,
HE'S UNDER PRESSURE.

203
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,300
HE IS HIT.
THE BALL'S LOOSE!

204
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:27,834
THE BALL IS LOOSE!

205
00:08:27,901 --> 00:08:29,467
AND BEARS HAVE IT!

206
00:08:29,534 --> 00:08:31,133
THE BEARS GOT IT!

207
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,834

Radio: YES, SIR,
THAT'S FUSTER

209
00:08:35,033 --> 00:08:36,601
WHO CAME UP WITH
THE LOOSE BALL...

210
00:08:36,667 --> 00:08:37,901
GREAT!

211
00:08:37,968 --> 00:08:40,167
AND THE BEARS' DEFENSE
COMES THROUGH ONCE AGAIN,

212
00:08:40,234 --> 00:08:42,701
AND THIS CROWD
AT SOLDIER FIELD

213
00:08:42,767 --> 00:08:45,334
IS JUST GOING
BANANAS, FOLKS.

214
00:08:47,267 --> 00:08:49,467
BEARS WILL HAVE IT
FIRST AND 10

215
00:08:49,534 --> 00:08:50,968
POINTING IN
THE OTHER DIRECTION.

[WHISTLE]

217
00:08:52,901 --> 00:08:54,367
THERE'S A BREAK
IN THE ACTION ON THE FIELD.

218
00:09:00,801 --> 00:09:02,400
RIGHT HERE, MR. FEENEY.

219
00:09:18,534 --> 00:09:19,467
HEY,
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

220
00:09:19,534 --> 00:09:20,801
YOU MISSED
THE ENTIRE
FIRST QUARTER.

221
00:09:20,868 --> 00:09:23,701
WELL, I WENT TO THE RESTROOM
AND STOOD THERE AT THAT TROUGH,

222
00:09:23,767 --> 00:09:26,300
BUT NO DICE.

223
00:09:26,367 --> 00:09:27,467
SO I RAN ACROSS THE STREET

224
00:09:27,534 --> 00:09:29,767
AND RENTED A ROOM
AT THE RADISSON.

225
00:09:29,834 --> 00:09:32,033
BEST $34.50 I EVER SPENT.

226
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,534
EXCUSE ME, EXCUSE ME.

227
00:09:33,601 --> 00:09:35,534
HEY, WE DIDN'T EXPECT
TO SEE YOU SO SOON.

228
00:09:35,601 --> 00:09:36,868
I TOOK A SHORTCUT.

00:09:41,033 --> 00:09:43,367
I DO.
ME TOO! ME TOO!

232
00:09:45,868 --> 00:09:47,267
AAH!

HI, DADDY.
HI, DADDY.

236
00:09:58,033 --> 00:09:59,334
HEY, BABY.
HOW ARE YOU, SUGAR?

237
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,734
YOU KNOW, DETROIT ALMOST
HAD US THERE FOR A MINUTE.

238
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:03,534
THEN MY SHIRT KICKED IN.

239
00:10:03,601 --> 00:10:06,067
DID YOU BRING US SOMETHING?
DID YOU BRING US SOMETHING?

240
00:10:06,133 --> 00:10:08,567

BRING YOU SOMETHING.

OH, CHERYL,
YOU MISSED A GREAT GAME.

249
00:10:23,901 --> 00:10:25,968
I MEAN, FIRST I BOUGHT
A SMALL POPCORN,

250
00:10:26,033 --> 00:10:27,501
THEY GAVE ME A LARGE.

251
00:10:28,601 --> 00:10:29,734
WHAT'S FOR DINNER?

252
00:10:29,801 --> 00:10:31,100
I THOUGHT
WE'D HAVE STEAKS.

253
00:10:31,167 --> 00:10:32,334
OH, STEAKS. GREAT.

254
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:35,367
YEAH, I'M JUST GONNA
RUN OUT TO THE GARAGE,

255
00:10:35,434 --> 00:10:36,667
GRAB THEM
OUT OF THE FREEZER.

256
00:10:36,734 --> 00:10:39,968
UH, HONEY, LET ME GET THEM
FOR YOU. I'LL GET THEM.

NO, NO, NO, NO.
HONEY, COME ON.

258
00:10:41,334 --> 00:10:42,934
YOU'VE HAD A HARD DAY.

261
00:10:47,501 --> 00:10:49,834
YOU HAVE DONE
A LOT OF STUFF.

262
00:10:49,901 --> 00:10:51,200
LET ME GET THEM.

OH, YOU KNOW WHAT,
HONEY?

264
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,868
YOU KNOW, I ALREADY
HAD STEAK AT THE GAME.

265
00:11:00,634 --> 00:11:04,334
THEY SELL STEAK
AT SOLDIER FIELD NOW?

A CARD AND EVERYTHING,

270
00:11:14,534 --> 00:11:16,067
I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S
GONNA WORK IN FOOTBALL.

271
00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:19,501
YOU KNOW, THE TENDERNESS
IS NOT QUITE THE SAME
ON A STICK.

272
00:11:19,567 --> 00:11:21,767
IS THERE SOMETHING
YOU NEED TO TELL ME?

YOU KNOW, I FEEL LIKE
THAT GUY IN THE MOVIE,

276
00:11:31,167 --> 00:11:33,167
HE'S GOT TO CUT
THE RED WIRE
OR THE GREEN WIRE

277
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:35,467
SO THE BOMB
DOESN'T GO OFF.

278
00:11:37,334 --> 00:11:40,801
WELL, WHY DON'T YOU
JUST CUT THE CRAP WIRE?

279
00:11:44,667 --> 00:11:47,634
OKAY, I STUCK THE CAT
IN THE FREEZER.

280
00:11:47,701 --> 00:11:49,701
BUT, YOU KNOW,
I MEAN, THE GROUND

281
00:11:49,767 --> 00:11:51,901
WAS WAY HARDER
THAN I THOUGHT
IT WAS, HONEY.

282
00:11:51,968 --> 00:11:53,767
I THOUGHT I COULD COME
HOME AFTER THE GAME

283
00:11:53,834 --> 00:11:55,067
AND BURY MR. FEENEY.

284
00:11:55,133 --> 00:11:57,701
I WANTED
TO DO THE JOB RIGHT.

285
00:11:57,767 --> 00:12:00,667
NO, YOU WANTED TO GO
TO YOUR STUPID FOOTBALL GAME.

00:12:08,367 --> 00:12:14,300
ALL RIGHT, NOW THIS IS
HOW FIGHTS GET STARTED.

290
00:12:14,367 --> 00:12:16,701
SO I THINK THE THING
THAT WE SHOULD DO

291
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:18,601
IS TABLE THIS DISCUSSION

292

TILL AFTER
WE'VE HAD OUR STEAKS.

293
00:12:20,801 --> 00:12:24,400
I LOVE THAT YOU ACTUALLY THINK
I'M MAKING YOU DINNER.

AW, COME ON. TOUCH IT.

303
00:12:48,467 --> 00:12:50,300
I'M NOT GONNA
TOUCH THAT CAT.
YOU TOUCH IT.

304
00:12:50,367 --> 00:12:51,701
I'LL GIVE YOU A BUCK
IF YOU TOUCH IT.

305
00:12:51,767 --> 00:12:54,501
WHAT DO I GOTTA DO
TO IT FOR A $50?

306
00:12:54,567 --> 00:12:57,100
THAT'S WRONG.

307
00:12:58,267 --> 00:12:59,334
HEY, GUYS.

308
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,434

IT'D BE A LONG TIME
BEFORE I GAVE HIM ANY SUGAR.

313
00:13:13,133 --> 00:13:16,167
ANDY, LET'S NOT PLAY
"IF I WERE A WOMAN."

314
00:13:17,167 --> 00:13:19,167
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
YOU HAD A CAT.

315
