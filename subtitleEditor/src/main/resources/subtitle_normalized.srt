You are so not listening

21
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,267
[ groans ]

00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:00,901
Hey, buddy.

Soft spot getting

32
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:38,934
Mr. feeney!

33
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,868

34
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:42,968

35
00:01:43,033 --> 00:01:45,000
oh, yeah,
i washed it.

36
00:01:45,067 --> 00:01:46,868
You washed
my game day shirt?

37
00:01:46,934 --> 00:01:48,100
yeah.

38
00:01:48,167 --> 00:01:49,801
You don't wash
game day shirt.

39
00:01:49,868 --> 00:01:51,434
That's bad luck.

40
00:01:51,501 --> 00:01:53,868
Oh, it's a good thing you don't
have game day underwear.

41
00:01:53,934 --> 00:01:57,534
Honey, you don't wear
underwear on game day.

42
00:01:57,601 --> 00:01:59,300
Damn. springtime fresh.

43
00:01:59,367 --> 00:02:00,300
What am i supposed
to do?

44
00:02:00,367 --> 00:02:01,734
here, honey.

45
00:02:01,801 --> 00:02:04,567
Hey, good idea.

46
00:02:04,634 --> 00:02:07,434
Oh, yeah,

47
00:02:07,501 --> 00:02:10,400
* are you ready
for some football? *

48
00:02:10,467 --> 00:02:12,834
I am ready
for some football!

49
00:02:12,901 --> 00:02:14,667
yeah! you are it!

50
00:02:14,734 --> 00:02:19,033
* are you ready
for some football? *

51
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:22,567
I thought we were all gonna
paint our faces.

52
00:02:22,634 --> 00:02:25,567
Uh, i guess we
forgot to tell you.

53
00:02:25,634 --> 00:02:28,133
Don't we look
like the idiots.

54
00:02:29,334 --> 00:02:30,501
Uncle andy?

55
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:31,667

56
00:02:31,734 --> 00:02:33,901

57
00:02:33,968 --> 00:02:36,234

an aia-certified
architect

58
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,234
and a stanford
graduate.

59
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:40,167
And on the weekends,
a clown.

60
00:02:40,234 --> 00:02:42,567
Here, honey,
snacks for the tailgate.

61
00:02:42,634 --> 00:02:44,033
Oh, baby,
you're the best.

62
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:46,100
You just bought yourself
another six months

63
00:02:46,167 --> 00:02:47,100
of being my wife.

64
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,501
Oh, yay.

65
00:02:49,834 --> 00:02:52,667
Mom,
gracie's chewing
with her mouth open.

66
00:02:52,734 --> 00:02:54,267
Aah!

67
00:02:54,334 --> 00:02:57,033
make gracie stop!
mom!

68
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:58,033
honey?

69
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:59,434
are you gonna
be all right?

70
00:02:59,501 --> 00:03:01,300
i mean, if you don't
want me to go, i won't.

71
00:03:01,367 --> 00:03:03,834
No, honey, i want you to go
and have a good time.

72
00:03:03,901 --> 00:03:06,334
Oh, i love
playing this game.

73
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,934
All: * bear down,
chicago bears *

74
00:03:11,367 --> 00:03:14,334
Radio: it is a gorgeous day
here on the lakefront.

75
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,200
We're about an hour away
from the opening kickoff.

76
00:03:17,267 --> 00:03:18,400
Whoo!
yes!

77
00:03:18,467 --> 00:03:19,534
and the bears
have yet to announce

78
00:03:19,601 --> 00:03:21,734
their starting quarterback.

79
00:03:21,801 --> 00:03:22,901
Mcnown.
Matthews.

80
00:03:22,968 --> 00:03:24,834
I have to pee.

81
00:03:24,901 --> 00:03:26,634
Well, we're not
gonna stop now.

82
00:03:26,701 --> 00:03:28,701
You can go
to the bathroom
in the stadium.

83
00:03:28,767 --> 00:03:31,334
You know i can't pee
in a trough.

84
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,567
All those men,
shoulder-to-shoulder --

85
00:03:33,634 --> 00:03:36,400
those stolen glances.

86
00:03:36,467 --> 00:03:38,067
Well, take your mind
off it.

87
00:03:38,133 --> 00:03:39,400
Think about
something else,

88
00:03:39,467 --> 00:03:42,067
like
a babbling brook

89
00:03:42,133 --> 00:03:43,601
or a waterfall.

90
00:03:43,667 --> 00:03:46,200
Yeah, or men peeing.

91
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:47,200
[ laughs ]

92
00:03:47,267 --> 00:03:49,567
[ cellular phone rings ]

93
00:03:49,634 --> 00:03:50,767
Yeah?

94
00:03:50,834 --> 00:03:52,067
cheryl.

95
00:03:52,133 --> 00:03:54,100
Okay, okay, honey,
calm down, calm down.

96
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:55,200
What's wrong?

97
00:03:55,267 --> 00:03:56,801
her cat died.

98
00:03:56,868 --> 00:03:58,100
Mr. feeney?

99
00:03:58,167 --> 00:04:00,200
oh, honey,
i'm really sorry.

100
00:04:00,267 --> 00:04:01,934
Listen,
we'll be there

101
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,501
As soon as the game
is over.

102
00:04:03,567 --> 00:04:04,701
I mean halftime.

103
00:04:04,767 --> 00:04:07,067
We're on our way.

104
00:04:07,133 --> 00:04:09,501
Bye.

105
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,767
Okay, don't worry.

106
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:13,234
This shouldn't
take long.

107
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:15,200
We should still make
the game by kickoff.

108
00:04:15,267 --> 00:04:17,801
Aw, poor cheryl.

109
00:04:17,868 --> 00:04:19,868
This is so sad.

110
00:04:19,934 --> 00:04:22,167
Yeah.

111
00:04:22,234 --> 00:04:24,567
I didn't even know
we still had a cat.

112
00:04:29,901 --> 00:04:31,834
Mr. feeney
is gonna love that.

113
00:04:31,901 --> 00:04:34,000
Sorry for your loss.

114
00:04:37,267 --> 00:04:38,734
Hi, honey.
Oh.

115
00:04:38,801 --> 00:04:40,868
Hi, girls.

116
00:04:40,934 --> 00:04:43,434
Oh, you're looking
at pictures of
mr. feeney, huh?

117
00:04:43,501 --> 00:04:45,801
I am so sorry
we ruined your day.

118
00:04:45,868 --> 00:04:46,834
Where is he?

119
00:04:46,901 --> 00:04:47,934
In the upstairs bathroom.

120
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,801
Aah!

121
00:04:50,868 --> 00:04:52,567
He died in his litter box.

122
00:04:52,634 --> 00:04:53,734
Aw.

123
00:04:53,801 --> 00:04:56,567
Like elvis.

124
00:04:56,634 --> 00:04:59,300
I got this box and this towel
to wrap him in,

125
00:04:59,367 --> 00:05:01,033
But then
i just couldn't do it.

126
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,467
Oh, sweetie,
i'll take care of it.

127
00:05:02,534 --> 00:05:03,601
Oh, thank you.

128
00:05:03,667 --> 00:05:05,601
Hey, is this
one of the towels

129
00:05:05,667 --> 00:05:07,434
I got you
for your anniversary?

130
00:05:08,968 --> 00:05:10,434
I'll just go get him.

131
00:05:12,234 --> 00:05:14,434
I had to
special order them.

132
00:05:14,501 --> 00:05:16,968
Honey, i-i thought
it would be nice for the girls

133
00:05:17,067 --> 00:05:19,501
If we took a few minutes
to say goodbye to mr. feeney,

134
00:05:19,567 --> 00:05:22,100
So if you could
say something...

135
00:05:22,167 --> 00:05:24,000
Sure.

136
00:05:25,434 --> 00:05:26,567
Okay, everybody,

137
00:05:26,634 --> 00:05:29,367
Cheryl would like us
to say a few words,

138
00:05:29,434 --> 00:05:32,501
So i'll start.

139
00:05:32,567 --> 00:05:36,467
We are assembled here
today to pay tribute

140
00:05:36,534 --> 00:05:38,634
To this cat --

141
00:05:38,701 --> 00:05:40,334
Wrapped in egyptian cotton.

142
00:05:42,434 --> 00:05:44,434
We're here to say
goodbye.

143
00:05:44,501 --> 00:05:49,400
Mr. feeney was more
than just a cat
to cheryl.

144
00:05:49,467 --> 00:05:51,467
He was like a dog
to her.

145
00:05:53,868 --> 00:05:56,701
And i know if mr. feeney
were here right now,

146
00:05:56,767 --> 00:05:58,901
He would say,

147
00:05:58,968 --> 00:06:00,667
"bury me and move on
with your day."

148
00:06:02,567 --> 00:06:04,467
"enjoy life.

149
00:06:04,534 --> 00:06:06,133
"eat a pizza.

150
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:09,434
"i mean, it's not my thing,
but you may like it.

151
00:06:09,501 --> 00:06:11,434
"or do whatever
you were planning to do

152
00:06:11,501 --> 00:06:13,634
"on this beautiful
sunday afternoon.

153
00:06:13,701 --> 00:06:16,300
I mean, come on,
already. i'm dead."

154
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,734
Okay, ruby, your turn.

155
00:06:19,801 --> 00:06:21,901
Once mr. feeney
slept in my bed

156
00:06:21,968 --> 00:06:24,300
And woke me up
by biting my nose.

157
00:06:24,367 --> 00:06:26,200
Isn't that sweet?

158
00:06:26,267 --> 00:06:27,467
Okay, next.

159
00:06:27,534 --> 00:06:29,133
And then gracie and i
Played kitchen

160
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,000
And made pancakes
and waffles,

161
00:06:31,067 --> 00:06:33,767
But not real ones.
It was pretend.

162
00:06:33,834 --> 00:06:37,300
That's so beautiful,
honey. okay, next.

163
00:06:37,367 --> 00:06:40,267
And then -- and then --
there was this one time

164
00:06:40,334 --> 00:06:42,868
When we went
to st. louis --

165
00:06:42,934 --> 00:06:43,868
Uh-huh.

166
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:46,367
* the cupcake man,
the cupcake man *

167
00:06:46,434 --> 00:06:48,634
* who was born one day
in a muffin pan *

168
00:06:48,701 --> 00:06:50,634
Both: * he ran away
from the baker's shop *

169
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:52,767
* and then he married
a lollipop *

170
00:06:52,834 --> 00:06:53,767
Okay, okay, okay.

171
00:06:53,834 --> 00:06:55,767
Okay,
that was beautiful.

172
00:06:55,834 --> 00:06:57,767
Thank you, ruby.

173
00:06:57,834 --> 00:06:59,000
Andy.

174
00:07:00,501 --> 00:07:01,634
Gracie, sweetie,

175
00:07:01,701 --> 00:07:03,033
Do you have something
you want to say?

176
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:06,300
I loved him.

177
00:07:07,567 --> 00:07:10,400
See, ruby? three words.

178
00:07:14,868 --> 00:07:17,033
Girls, that was perfect.

179
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,734
Why don't we go
to the park now?

180
00:07:18,801 --> 00:07:20,334
Go up and grab your sweaters

181
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,834
And we'll get
your little brother.

182
00:07:21,901 --> 00:07:23,601
Jim?

183
00:07:23,667 --> 00:07:26,100
Would you please bury
mr. feeney in the backyard?

184
00:07:26,167 --> 00:07:27,501
Sure, honey, sure.

185
00:07:27,567 --> 00:07:29,734
Okay, let's go.

186
00:07:29,801 --> 00:07:31,033
Honey.

187
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:35,400
You mean now?

188
00:07:35,467 --> 00:07:39,000
I don't want the girls
to see. okay?

189
00:07:39,067 --> 00:07:40,267
Yeah.

190
00:07:44,467 --> 00:07:46,634
Well, why don't you guys
go ahead to the game?

191
00:07:46,701 --> 00:07:48,801
And i'll just get there
when i can.

192
00:07:48,868 --> 00:07:50,234
You sure there's
nothing we can do?

193
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,300
Well, you can help me dig.

194
00:07:52,367 --> 00:07:54,834
It's just
an expression.

195
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,334
Radio: that last play,
gaining about a yard.

196
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,601
So, batch and the lions

197
00:08:10,667 --> 00:08:12,167
Faced with a third and goal.

198
00:08:12,234 --> 00:08:13,767
Call at
the eight-yard line.

199
00:08:13,834 --> 00:08:17,300
We're tied at 17,
But don't go anywhere.

200
00:08:17,367 --> 00:08:18,801
Here's the snap.

201
00:08:18,868 --> 00:08:21,367
Batch roaming
to his right.

202
00:08:21,434 --> 00:08:24,133
Looking in the end zone,
he's under pressure.

203
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,300
He is hit.
The ball's loose!

204
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:27,834
The ball is loose!

205
00:08:27,901 --> 00:08:29,467
And bears have it!

206
00:08:29,534 --> 00:08:31,133
The bears got it!

207
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,834
Yes! yes!

208
00:08:33,901 --> 00:08:34,968
Radio: yes, sir,
that's fuster

209
00:08:35,033 --> 00:08:36,601
Who came up with
the loose ball...

210
00:08:36,667 --> 00:08:37,901
Great!

211
00:08:37,968 --> 00:08:40,167
And the bears' defense
comes through once again,

212
00:08:40,234 --> 00:08:42,701
And this crowd
at soldier field

213
00:08:42,767 --> 00:08:45,334
Is just going
bananas, folks.

214
00:08:47,267 --> 00:08:49,467
Bears will have it
first and 10

215
00:08:49,534 --> 00:08:50,968
Pointing in
the other direction.

216
00:08:51,033 --> 00:08:52,834
[whistle]

217
00:08:52,901 --> 00:08:54,367
There's a break
in the action on the field.

218
00:09:00,801 --> 00:09:02,400
Right here, mr. feeney.

219
00:09:18,534 --> 00:09:19,467
Hey,
where have you been?

220
00:09:19,534 --> 00:09:20,801
You missed
the entire
first quarter.

221
00:09:20,868 --> 00:09:23,701
Well, i went to the restroom
and stood there at that trough,

222
00:09:23,767 --> 00:09:26,300
But no dice.

223
00:09:26,367 --> 00:09:27,467
So i ran across the street

224
00:09:27,534 --> 00:09:29,767
And rented a room
at the radisson.

225
00:09:29,834 --> 00:09:32,033
Best $34.50 i ever spent.

226
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,534
Excuse me, excuse me.

227
00:09:33,601 --> 00:09:35,534
Hey, we didn't expect
to see you so soon.

228
00:09:35,601 --> 00:09:36,868
I took a shortcut.

229
00:09:36,934 --> 00:09:38,400
[ cheering ]

230
00:09:38,467 --> 00:09:40,968
Who wants a popsicle?

231
00:09:41,033 --> 00:09:43,367
I do.
Me too! me too!

232
00:09:45,868 --> 00:09:47,267
Aah!

233
00:09:47,334 --> 00:09:50,834
[ cheering ]

234
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:56,734
We won! we won!

235
00:09:56,801 --> 00:09:57,968
Hi, daddy.
Hi, daddy.

236
00:09:58,033 --> 00:09:59,334
Hey, baby.
How are you, sugar?

237
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,734
You know, detroit almost
had us there for a minute.

238
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:03,534
Then my shirt kicked in.

239
00:10:03,601 --> 00:10:06,067
Did you bring us something?
did you bring us something?

240
00:10:06,133 --> 00:10:08,567
Honey, i always
bring you something.

241
00:10:08,634 --> 00:10:10,801
Here.

242
00:10:10,868 --> 00:10:12,567
Whoa!

243
00:10:12,634 --> 00:10:14,801
Crinkly!

244
00:10:14,868 --> 00:10:17,234
And for you, baby...

245
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:18,667
Paper!

246
00:10:18,734 --> 00:10:19,767
Thank you, daddy!

247
00:10:19,834 --> 00:10:21,200
You're welcome, honey.

248
00:10:21,267 --> 00:10:23,834
Oh, cheryl,
you missed a great game.

249
00:10:23,901 --> 00:10:25,968
I mean, first i bought
a small popcorn,

250
00:10:26,033 --> 00:10:27,501
They gave me a large.

251
00:10:28,601 --> 00:10:29,734
What's for dinner?

252
00:10:29,801 --> 00:10:31,100
I thought
we'd have steaks.

253
00:10:31,167 --> 00:10:32,334
Oh, steaks. great.

254
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:35,367
Yeah, i'm just gonna
run out to the garage,

255
00:10:35,434 --> 00:10:36,667
Grab them
out of the freezer.

256
00:10:36,734 --> 00:10:39,968
Uh, honey, let me get them
for you. i'll get them.

257
00:10:40,033 --> 00:10:41,267
No, no, no, no.
Honey, come on.

258
00:10:41,334 --> 00:10:42,934
You've had a hard day.

259
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,234
Going to the game,
eating peanuts,

260
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:47,434
Burying my cat.

261
00:10:47,501 --> 00:10:49,834
You have done
a lot of stuff.

262
00:10:49,901 --> 00:10:51,200
Let me get them.

263
00:10:51,267 --> 00:10:55,133
Oh, you know what,
honey?

264
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,868
You know, i already
had steak at the game.

265
00:11:00,634 --> 00:11:04,334
They sell steak
at soldier field now?

266
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:07,801
Yeah, it's called,
uh, steak on a stick.

267
00:11:07,868 --> 00:11:11,100
Apparently,
we're a test city.

268
00:11:11,167 --> 00:11:12,167
You know,
i had to fill out

269
00:11:12,234 --> 00:11:14,467
A card and everything,
you know.

270
00:11:14,534 --> 00:11:16,067
I don't know if it's
gonna work in football.

271
00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:19,501
You know, the tenderness
is not quite the same
on a stick.

272
00:11:19,567 --> 00:11:21,767
Is there something
you need to tell me?

273
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,467
Uh...

274
00:11:24,534 --> 00:11:26,567
I love you?

275
00:11:28,501 --> 00:11:31,100
You know, i feel like
that guy in the movie,

276
00:11:31,167 --> 00:11:33,167
He's got to cut
the red wire
or the green wire

277
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:35,467
So the bomb
doesn't go off.

278
00:11:37,334 --> 00:11:40,801
Well, why don't you
just cut the crap wire?

279
00:11:44,667 --> 00:11:47,634
Okay, i stuck the cat
in the freezer.

280
00:11:47,701 --> 00:11:49,701
But, you know,
i mean, the ground

281
00:11:49,767 --> 00:11:51,901
Was way harder
than i thought
it was, honey.

282
00:11:51,968 --> 00:11:53,767
I thought i could come
home after the game

283
00:11:53,834 --> 00:11:55,067
And bury mr. feeney.

284
00:11:55,133 --> 00:11:57,701
I wanted
to do the job right.

285
00:11:57,767 --> 00:12:00,667
No, you wanted to go
to your stupid football game.

286
00:12:00,734 --> 00:12:02,367
Honey, let's not
say something

287
00:12:02,434 --> 00:12:04,567
We're gonna
regret later.

288
00:12:04,634 --> 00:12:08,300
You mean like "i do"?

289
00:12:08,367 --> 00:12:14,300
All right, now this is
how fights get started.

290
00:12:14,367 --> 00:12:16,701
So i think the thing
that we should do

291
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:18,601
Is table this discussion

292
00:12:18,667 --> 00:12:20,734
Till after
we've had our steaks.

293
00:12:20,801 --> 00:12:24,400
I love that you actually think
i'm making you dinner.

294
00:12:26,334 --> 00:12:28,367
Come on, honey.
It's just a cat.

295
00:12:30,234 --> 00:12:32,200
Damn.

296
00:12:32,267 --> 00:12:33,701
Red wire.

297
00:12:38,501 --> 00:12:40,234
Poor mr. feeney.

298
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:42,801
He looks like
he's stalking
those frozen peas.

299
00:12:42,868 --> 00:12:43,801
Hey, ed.
Huh?

300
00:12:43,868 --> 00:12:45,067
Touch it.

301
00:12:45,133 --> 00:12:47,133
I'm not touching it,
man. you touch it.

302
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,400
Aw, come on. touch it.

303
00:12:48,467 --> 00:12:50,300
I'm not gonna
touch that cat.
You touch it.

304
00:12:50,367 --> 00:12:51,701
I'll give you a buck
if you touch it.

305
00:12:51,767 --> 00:12:54,501
What do i gotta do
to it for a $50?

306
00:12:54,567 --> 00:12:57,100
That's wrong.

307
00:12:58,267 --> 00:12:59,334
Hey, guys.

308
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,434
Jim, i thought
you buried him.

309
00:13:01,501 --> 00:13:04,033
Well, i didn't.

310
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:06,501
Your sister's all
pissed off at me, too.

311
00:13:06,567 --> 00:13:09,033
If i were a woman
and my husband froze my cat,

312
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:13,067
It'd be a long time
before i gave him any sugar.

313
00:13:13,133 --> 00:13:16,167
Andy, let's not play
"if i were a woman."

314
00:13:17,167 --> 00:13:19,167
I didn't even know
you had a cat.

315
00:13:19,234 --> 00:13:20,767
Thank you.

316
00:13:20,834 --> 00:13:22,701
Women and cats, huh?

317
00:13:22,767 --> 00:13:23,834
Yeah, right.

318
00:13:23,901 --> 00:13:24,834
I don't get it.

319
00:13:24,901 --> 00:13:26,267
I mean, all they do
is eat, sleep,

320
00:13:26,334 --> 00:13:28,367
And stare at you
while you're having sex.

321
00:13:28,434 --> 00:13:29,834
Women or cats?

322
00:13:31,501 --> 00:13:34,367
We're in a fight now.

323
00:13:34,434 --> 00:13:37,167
She's all upset.

324
00:13:37,234 --> 00:13:39,734
You know, there are no cats
mentioned in the bible.

325
00:13:42,767 --> 00:13:44,434
Thank you, tony.

326
00:13:44,501 --> 00:13:46,434
Who knows what goes on
in the mind of a woman?

327
00:13:46,501 --> 00:13:47,667
Yeah.
Yeah.

[ all laugh ]
All right.

00:13:51,667 --> 00:13:53,234
All right,

332
00:14:03,767 --> 00:14:06,133
Okay, the girls are
playing in their room

00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,767
And i put kyle down.

334
00:14:07,834 --> 00:14:09,601
How'd you get him
to go to sleep so fast?

335
00:14:09,667 --> 00:14:11,267
Same way i do
with all guys.

336
00:14:11,334 --> 00:14:13,801
I told him
about my day.

337
00:14:13,868 --> 00:14:16,067
I just -- i can't believe
jim did this.

338
00:14:16,133 --> 00:14:18,167
You know, cheryl, i know
this great guy for you.

339
00:14:18,234 --> 00:14:20,667
He lives in my complex,
he also has kids,

340
00:14:20,734 --> 00:14:23,667
And i'm totally done
dating him.

341
00:14:23,734 --> 00:14:27,200
The guy with
the porsche?
i like him.

342
00:14:27,267 --> 00:14:28,267
Guys.

343
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:29,801
Sorry.

344
00:14:29,868 --> 00:14:31,901
Mr. feeney.

345
00:14:31,968 --> 00:14:34,167
Oh, i miss him, too.

346
00:14:34,234 --> 00:14:36,567
Those cute little whiskers

347
00:14:36,634 --> 00:14:38,801
And those little paws.

348
00:14:38,868 --> 00:14:41,334
Nothing will
ever replace him.

349
00:14:42,734 --> 00:14:44,200
Oh, a doggie!

350
00:14:44,267 --> 00:14:46,067
A doggie!

351
00:14:46,133 --> 00:14:48,534
Girls, come on down.

352
00:14:48,601 --> 00:14:51,033
I got a big surprise
for you.

353
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,801
Cheryl?

354
00:14:52,868 --> 00:14:53,934
Mm-hmm.

355
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,133
After our talk,

356
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,601
I said to myself,

357
00:14:58,667 --> 00:15:00,834
"she lost her cat.

358
00:15:00,901 --> 00:15:03,167
"she loved that cat.

359
00:15:03,234 --> 00:15:05,701
She's sad
about that cat."

360
00:15:05,767 --> 00:15:08,100
So i got you a dog.

361
00:15:08,167 --> 00:15:10,801
A dog?

362
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:11,901
Yeah, i figured
i'd get something

363
00:15:11,968 --> 00:15:14,067
That all of us
could love.

364
00:15:14,133 --> 00:15:15,167
Isn't it great?

365
00:15:15,234 --> 00:15:19,634
I named him
gary sinise.

366
00:15:19,701 --> 00:15:22,601
Jim, you're the one
who's always wanted a dog.

367
00:15:22,667 --> 00:15:25,167
Gary sinise
is a great actor.

368
00:15:25,234 --> 00:15:28,834
He could play a cat.

369
00:15:28,901 --> 00:15:30,734
[ giggles ]
He likes me.

370
00:15:30,801 --> 00:15:32,868
He's licking me.

371
00:15:32,934 --> 00:15:36,434
You know,
he licks himself, too.

372
00:15:36,501 --> 00:15:38,300
Problem...

373
00:15:38,367 --> 00:15:40,067
Problem solved.

[ groans ]

375
00:15:49,734 --> 00:15:50,901
What are you doing?

376
00:15:50,968 --> 00:15:53,000
I'm gonna bury my cat.

377
00:15:53,067 --> 00:15:55,701
Give me that.
Let me do it.

378
00:15:55,767 --> 00:15:57,434
Honey, you're not
gonna be able to --

379
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:01,767
How did you do that?

Cheryl...

381
00:16:04,434 --> 00:16:06,000
Come on.
I got you a dog.

382
00:16:06,067 --> 00:16:08,601
Getting a dog
is a quick fix,

383
00:16:08,667 --> 00:16:10,801
Like putting a cat
in a freezer.

384
00:16:10,868 --> 00:16:12,767
You know, that's like
getting skis for someone

385
00:16:12,834 --> 00:16:14,334
Who just broke their leg.

386
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,934
Here we go
with the skis again.

387
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,767
This is not about skis.

388
00:16:18,834 --> 00:16:19,834
I know.

389
00:16:19,901 --> 00:16:21,767
What's it about,
then? tell me,
will ya?

390
00:16:21,834 --> 00:16:24,300
It's about
you not being there for me.

391
00:16:24,367 --> 00:16:25,767
Oh, come on.

392
00:16:25,834 --> 00:16:28,100
Dana and andy --
they went to the game,
too.

393
00:16:28,167 --> 00:16:30,000
Why aren't you mad
at them?

394
00:16:30,067 --> 00:16:32,834
I'm not married
to andy and dana.

395
00:16:32,901 --> 00:16:34,834
I needed
a little bit of compassion

396
00:16:34,901 --> 00:16:37,033
From the man i love.

397
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,968
Cheryl, look,
if you want me

398
00:16:39,033 --> 00:16:41,834
To feel the same way
you do about the cat,

399
00:16:41,901 --> 00:16:43,667
Well, i don't.

400
00:16:43,734 --> 00:16:47,267
It's a shame
that your cat died,

401
00:16:47,334 --> 00:16:49,534
But, hey, let's look
at the silver lining --

402

all day.

You gotta help me
here.

I-i don't know
what you want.

406
00:16:58,501 --> 00:17:00,067
I'm not
a mind reader.

407
00:17:00,133 --> 00:17:02,400
Jim, you don't have
to be a mind reader

408
00:17:02,467 --> 00:17:05,100
To ask me how i'm feeling.

409
00:17:05,167 --> 00:17:07,067
You know...

410
00:17:07,133 --> 00:17:10,701
I had that cat for 15 years.

411
00:17:10,767 --> 00:17:14,267
It was the last thing i had left
from before i met you,

412
00:17:14,334 --> 00:17:17,033
From before i was
somebody's wife and --

413
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:19,801
And somebody's mother.

414
00:17:19,868 --> 00:17:24,501
You know, a whole part
of my life died today.

when mr. feeney was born.

Took him home,

the whole night with us.

No, uh...
